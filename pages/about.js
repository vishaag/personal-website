        <p>I'm a computer science engineer with a focus on front-end engineering. I love working with the latest front-end tools and keeping myself updated with the ecosystem. I'm actively looking for my next role, so if you're hiring, please get in touch with me! You can find my <a href="/VishaagSuriyanarayananResume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume here.</a></p>
        <p>Apart from programming, I like conversations around life, purpose, philosophy and travel. In an alternate universe if I hadn't gone into programming, I would've probably become a pizza chef. Here's a picture of the first ever pizza I made last year.</p>

        <p>I also love the outdoors, although I really don't go out as often as I'd want to, and the current situation isn't making it any easier. Here's a picture of me standing somewhere in Nusa Penida, Indonesia last year December. Ping me if you wanna know where this is ðŸ˜‰.</p>
